    <div style="--i:3" class="content"><p>Many people find themselves on hopeless paths, working tirelessly towards their goals but feeling uncertain about their chances of success. Despite their best efforts, they often face setbacks and frustration, which can lead to feelings of hopelessness and depression. For some, these persistent failures can escalate to severe mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts, self-harm, or even suicide. In this generation, where cheating often seems to outweigh loyalty, finding genuine support is increasingly difficult. The responsibility to create a happy and low-stress environment lies with the government, which should focus on policies and systems that promote mental well-being and support for its citizens. However, the greediness for money and power often leads to a failure in addressing these crucial needs, leaving individuals to navigate their struggles largely on their own. This neglect can exacerbate feelings of isolation and helplessness, making it even harder for people to find the support they need to cope with stress and depression.<br><br>Clearly, life can be especially challenging for those who refuse to blindly follow societal norms and question accepted beliefs. While many conform to traditional paths—such as accepting religious doctrines, adhering to the idea that the education system is perfect, or striving solely for top grades—those who think independently and challenge these norms often face greater difficulties. Their critical thinking and refusal to follow the crowd can make their journey more isolating and frustrating, as they navigate a world that frequently values conformity over individual thought and integrity.</p></div>
