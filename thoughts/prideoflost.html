    <div style="--i:3" class="content"><p>In the modern perspective religion/nation is nothing but another name for propaganda for people, in which they believe and will sacrifice themselves and kill people in the name of religion/nation.<br><br>Religion in a broader sense started as a tool of rationality as the man was too afraid of certain things, earlier religion tried to reason things but as there is no space for improvements people take them as the only sole reason of life, they'd believe on some fancy pants prophet or arabian barbaric man than a person who has the ability to think, religion now has no other meaning, politicians and corrupt people use it for their convenience, take any example Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism to some extent, all these religions are the reason people are dying, bombings, terrorist attacks, mostly all are because of religious extremism, most people who we think are very wise, intelligent, successful are either agnostics or atheists.<br><br>And as <span class="boldest">Arthur Schopenhauer</span> said <span class="bold">“The cheapest sort of pride is national pride; for if a man is proud of his nation, it argues that he has no qualities of his own of which he can be proud.”</span> And yes, this applies only to blind nationalism, to people who loudly declare “I am Indian,” “I am American,” or “I am Russian” without having done anything meaningful for themselves or their country.<br><br>Yes, you were born there. But why the celebration? Why the pride?<br>Is it because people centuries ago achieved something under the same flag?<br>What have you done?<br>Have you contributed anything?<br>Have you built something, achieved something, or improved the society you claim to be so proud of?<br><br>I honestly believe that if we were one nation instead of many, we’d grow much faster together. We could focus more on taking care of the environment, sharing knowledge, reducing conflicts, and improving life for everyone rather than fighting over borders.<br><br><span class="bold">Pride in a nation without personal effort is not patriotism, it is borrowed glory. And borrowed glory is the weakest kind of pride. Same for religion.</span><br><br>This page is not completed.</p></div>
